<para>A Coordinated Set is defined as a group of devices that are configured to support a specific scenario.<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Examples of Coordinated Sets include a pair of hearing aids, a pair of earbuds, or a speaker set that receives multi-channel audio and that reacts to control commands in a coordinated way (e.g., volume up and volume down).</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>CSIS is agnostic to the actual features and functions of the devices. The purpose of CSIS is to specify how a device can be discovered as part of a Coordinated Set and how to grant a client exclusive access to the Coordinated Set to avoid race conditions when multiple clients want to access the Coordinated Set at the same time. </para>
